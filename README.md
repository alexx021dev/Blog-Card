## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries (mobile-first approach)
- Modern CSS functions like `min()`, `max()`

---

### What I learned

I learned how to:

- Center containers both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox

- Use `min()`, `max()`, and `border-radius` to build a responsive, clean UI

- Handle responsive layout using media queries

- Use `box-shadow` and color to add depth and contrast

```css
.container {
  width: min(90%, 400px);
  margin: auto;
  padding: 1.2rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 5px 10px 0 black;
}
